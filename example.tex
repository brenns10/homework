\problemsection{Page XYZ}

\begin{problem}{3}
This is an example problem. It is here to serve as a
placeholder in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this \LaTeX{}
document class.

Note that you can still do paragraph breaks within problems.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4}
This would presumably be the next problem.
\end{problem}

\problemsection{Page ABC}

\begin{problem}{10}
This is a problem form a different section or source.
\end{problem}

\newpage

\begin{problem}{17}
Here's yet another problem. I've manually inserted a page break in
order to demonstrate the appearance of the header on pages after the
first.
